# Mobile-Computing-Project-2
Mobile application that classifies Handwritten Digits using Deep Learning Framework built in Keras
upload
Upload a handwritten digit pictures to the server and use the server to classify the digits. The digits should be placed in their respective folders after the classification of the images.
1. Backend code is written in Flask to build the server. 
2. The application is built on Android Studio using Java. 
3. Used OKHttp to post image to the server 
4. Used the MNIST Dataset to built the Deep Learning module using Keras and Tensorflow, used accuracy as the metric for performance of the model.
5. Folder gets classfied into respective folders.
